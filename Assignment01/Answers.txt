1:
- All programs have at least one algorithm.
Algorithms tell how how a program works to solve problems.
Programs can contain many algorithms to solve larger tasks.

2:
- A variable contains a datatype such as a number, a string of text, or
maybe an object. Variables can be assigned different values.

3:
- Variables need datatypes which define what value is
stored inside of each variable.
By strictly defining datatypes the compiler can check for errors.

In this case the disadvantage is that the programmer must beforehand
know what datatypes to use.

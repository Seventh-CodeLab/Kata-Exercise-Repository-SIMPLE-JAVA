# Java - PGR103 Object Orientated Programming
A repository that contains all manners of mini-java challenges and projects for college courses

"DC" folders are Daily Challenge tasks for PGR103 !
They contain smaller pieces of code with a distinct purpose. Usually done just as a way to practice logical thinking and produce meaningful results.
Some may not reflect my first version of them as I had initially forgotten to save some of the earlier ones and re-did them.

##You will find the code underneath the src folders of each of them

Files not part of the DC category are other projects I have done by myself as a way to learn more.
Usually larger scale in comparison to daily challenges.
